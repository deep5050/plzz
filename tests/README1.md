```note-red
There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.
For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.
Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.
But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.

## Plain texts

As they saw **there was no wolf**, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked <u>grumbling</u> down the <sup>hill</sup> once more.

## Highlights
Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">feet and cried out as loud as he could,</mark> “Wolf! Wolf!” But the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">villagers</mark> thought he was fooling them again, and so they <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">didn’t come to help</mark>.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.
</mark>
“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.
